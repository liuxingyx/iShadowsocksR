Bugfix
   * Mark basic constraints critical as appropriate. Note that the previous
     entry for this fix in the 2.16.10 changelog was in error, and it was not
     included in the 2.16.10 release as was stated.
     Make 'mbedtls_x509write_crt_set_basic_constraints' consistent with RFC
     5280 4.2.1.9 which says: "Conforming CAs MUST include this extension in
     all CA certificates that contain public keys used to validate digital
     signatures on certificates and MUST mark the extension as critical in
     such certificates." Previous to this change, the extension was always
     marked as non-critical. This was fixed by #4044.
